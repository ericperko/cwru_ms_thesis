\section{Steering}

This section details the steering algorithms used by this precision navigation stack

Specifically, the following will be discussed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Second Order steering
\item Phase Space steering
\item Lfollow for both linear paths and spin in places
	Need to mention the interaction with the PID time constants and such
\item Added a spin in place segment descriptor because of instabilities in the tiny arcs
\end{enumerate}
