\section{A look at existing Open Source options}

This will detail problems in ROS's Navigation stack when we last looked at it (and perhaps a discussion of how it has changed in the interim)

Outline:
	Mapping
		SimpleCostmap
		Fixed Grid size - needs changed for different environments and may affect trajectory scoring
		No option for temporal clearing of the map to reduce "leftovers" at small resolutions
	Local planning
		Scoring of trajectories
		Trajectories come from a fixed list of velocities and omegas (cross-product)
		simplistic cost function
		holonomic vs diff-drive
		scoring spin-in-place
	global planning
		dijkstra's planning
		replan only as a last resort
		may generate crappy plan since uses a circular robot with either inscribed or circumscribed radius
	localization
		defaults require tweaking for both map building and amcl
		amcl needs tuned to prevent "pops"
