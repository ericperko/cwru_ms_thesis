This thesis describes a precision navigation system for indoor mobile robots. It includes a precision localization subsystem based on a laser scanner, wheel encoders, gyroscope and \emph{a priori} map, and a precision path execution system made up of a steering algorithm, a trajectory generator and a simplistic path planner. Geometric parameterizations for path segments were developed for use by those components. The precision navigation system was evaluated using a physical robot, CWRU's HARLIE, as well as in simulation. The precision navigation system allowed HARLIE to precisely navigate indoors, following paths with as little as just over three centimeters of lateral offset. A number of avenues for building upon, and integrating with, the components developed in this thesis are also discussed.
